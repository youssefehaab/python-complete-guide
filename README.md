# python-complete-guide

This repo provides a complete guide to understand Python syntax using simple functions. Currenlty, project has 10 functions you can learn from.

## How this work?
I have applied simple mathematical calculations in Python, you can check the code in the ```___init__.py``` file inside functions directory.

## Things you will learn

- importing Python Libraries
- How to input/output data
- Catching errors instead of displaying them using try and except
- Defining classes in packages and calling them from a different Python file
- Defining functions
- Variable initialization
- if, elif, and else statements
- while loop

## Functions:

1. Area and Circumference of Circle (calculating Area and Circumference from radius)
2. Armstrong Number (or Narcissistic Number, sum of x digits each raised to the power of x)
3. Discount (calculates price after discount based on purchase amount)
4. Factorial (the product of all positive integers less than or equal to x)
5. Fibonacci (a set of integers starts with 0, followed by a 1, then by another 1, and then by a series of steadily incrementing number)
6. Palindrome (a sequence of letters and numbers that reads the same backwards as forwards)
7. Percentage Of Semester (calculates the percentage the semester, based on 5 subjects )
8. Prime Number (a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers)
9. Sum Of Digits (the sum of input number e.g. 55, sum of digits is 10)
10. Tax code (calculates your tax from purchase amount based on tax code 0, 1, 2, 3)



## How to run project?

> You will need Python and pip installed on your computer.

first install pyfiglet using this command on terminal
```
pip install pyfiglet
```
Then run the project using this command on terminal

```
python main.py
```

Or you can just use any IDE to run ```main.py``` file.
